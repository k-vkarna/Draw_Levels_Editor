## Introduction

Here is my c++ source code for LevelEditor - app, designed for edit and create levels for <a href="https://bitbucket.org/rrrfer-admin/drawing">"drawing"</a> game.

## LevelEditor app

In order to operate with levels, you need to have a "levels.db" file in the same folder as the LevelEditor application. You can use <a href="release\levels.db">this</a> or create your own. At the main window of the application, you can select any level to edit, if it exists, or create a new one. You can use the left mouse button to add a new point, or the right mouse button to remove the last point of the level.
Below is the demo by running the program LevelEditor:
